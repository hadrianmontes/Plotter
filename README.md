# Plotter
A program for plotting data from files and making compositions of multiple subplots in an easy way. 

For the use of pointfitter you will need scipy, tkinter,ttk,matplotlib and numpy. They are included with some distributions of python like the anaconda (spyder). There is a problem in Windows with the matplotlib installed by anaconda (spyder). It doen't contain one needed backend. This problem is fixed isntalling manually matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html

The fundamental way to use the aplication it's just tipping "python plotter.py". Also if you have exported a figure you can remake the figure and save it just tipping pyhton plotter inputfile outputfile. The advantage is that if you have updated your datafiles the final output will be updated to. You can also do this from inside the aplication.
